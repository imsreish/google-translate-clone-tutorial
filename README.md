#### Use this guide if you'd like to run this app locally.


#### *You will need an ```X-RapidAPI-Key``` generated by the [Google Translate API](https://rapidapi.com/datascraper/api/google-translate20/) available on RapidAPI.*


#### *This guide presumes you have git and npm installed (yarn should work in place of npm, but has not been tested).*


1) Get the link to clone this repo.
2) In your terminal, ```cd``` into your directory of choice and clone this repo.
3) Once cloned, ```cd``` into ```google-translate-clone-tutorial/```, then into ```google-translate-clone/```.
4) Run ```npm install``` to install/resolve any missing dependencies associated with this project.
5) Open your code editor at ```google-translate-clone/```.
6) A boilerplate ```env``` file is provided (it doesn't contain any keys). Look for ```env.txt``` at the root and change its name to simply ```.env```.
7) Inside of your ```.env``` file, replace ```!YOUR_KEY_HERE!``` with your Google Translate API ```X-RapidAPI-Key```, generated from RapidAPI. *Don't wrap the key in quotes, it will be automatically interpreted as a string.*
8) Running the installation has two parts:
- to start the backend, run ```npm run start:backend```.
- in a new tab, ```cd``` back to ```google-translate-clone/``` and run ```npm run start:frontend```.
